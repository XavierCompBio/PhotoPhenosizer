# Photo Phenosizer

A rapid machine learning-based method to measure cell dimensions in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast).

## Description

We have developed a streamline approach to acquiring cell dimensions in S. pombe. With this pipeline, one can go from microscopy images to statistical results about 10x faster using consumer level hardware than manual segmentation and measurements. It is built on the PyTorch framework with the utilization of DeeplabV3 for training purposes. However, any PyTorch trained models that can accept images can be used.

This program takes microscopy images of fission yeast cells as its input and it will output a csv file for each image. Each csv file contains the cell dimensions (area, length, and width).

The process is accomplished by utilizing a neural network to create an initial mask image of the cells that it was able to identify and then thresholding, erosion, and dilation is applied to clean up the initial mask. After, each cell is detected using sci-kit image libraries with area being measured using the same libraries. A python library, Feret, was used to measure the max and min feret diameters to correspond with length and width respectively. The program can optionally save any of the intermediate images throughout the process by using optional arguments.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Libraries that are required to run the program can be installed using this command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* PombePhenosizer (PP) is able to operate on any machine with Python 3.8 or above.

### Installing

* Set up a virtual environment and install all necessary libraries from requirements.txt
* [creating a virtual environment in Windows](docs/windows_venv.md)
* [creating a virtual environment in MacOS](docs/macos_venv.md)

### Training

We have had success training our own model using the DeepLabv#FineTunning repository: https://github.com/msminhas93/DeepLabv3FineTuning 

### Usage
#### General Instructions:

* First make sure that a virtual environment is setup and contains all of the libraries
1. First, put all of the microscopy images into a folder and change the directory path in the terminal to the path where the images are
2. Put the trained weights file into the same folder as this repository. To get a sample trained weights file, contact the authors. For training your own weights file from your own segmented images: [Training code](https://github.com/msminhas93/DeepLabv3FineTuning)
3. Run the below command if you have two images (image1.tif and image2.tif) and a weights file called 'weights.pt', which is a trained PyTorch model. If the weights file is called 'weights.pt' you do not need to add the optional argument, [--weights_file <filename>]. This weights argument is only for when you have a specific weights file that you want to use. The below command will produce image1.csv and image2.csv in a csv folder:
```
python process_images.py image1.tif image2.tif
```
* You can add optional parameters to specify the weights file and/or save the intermediate pictures:
```
python process_images.py [--weights_file <filename>] [--write_nn_mask] [--write_threshold_mask] [--write_area_filtered]
```
#### Bulk Image Processing Instructions:
   
* If you are using a bash shell or zsh shell you can use the \*.tif shortcut to loop through all of the images
```
python process_images.py *.tif
```
* If you are on WindowsOS you can run this command:

```
for %i in (*.tif) do python3 process_images.py %i [--write_nn_mask] [--write_threshold_mask] [--write_area_filtered] [--weights_file <filename>]
```
#### Other scripts:
* For the IOU script, run the command:
```
python calculate_iou.py image1.tif image2.tif
```

* For the accuracy classification script, run the command:
```
python classification_acc.py image1.tif image2.tif
```

* For labeling images, run the command:
```
python label_image.py image1-area_filtered.tif image2-area_filtered.tif 
```
This will create directories of 'labeled_csv' and 'labeled_images' where the labeled csv files and images will go to respectively.
## Help

To bring up a help message, run this command:
```
python process_images.py -h
```
This will bring the help menu up for more information on what arguments can be passed through.
