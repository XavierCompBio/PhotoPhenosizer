# Pombe Phenosizer

A rapid machine learning-based method to measure cell dimensions in S. pombe.

## Description

We have developed a streamline approach to acquiring cell dimensions in S. pombe. With this pipeline, one could go from microscopy images to statistical results about ten times faster than manual segmentation and measurments. It is built on the PyTorch framework with the utilization of DeeplabV3 for training purposes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Libraries that are required to run the program are: numpy, torch, torchvision, pillow, opencv-python, matplotlib. See requirements.txt to know which libraries to install.
* PombePhenosizer (PP) is able to operate on MacOS, WindowsOS, and Linux.

### Installing

* Set up a virtual environment and install all necessary libraries from requirements.txt
* [creating a virtual environment in Windows](docs/windows_venv.md)
* [creating a virtual environment in MacOS](docs/macos_venv.md)
* Training pipeline of the PP program came from this repository: https://github.com/msminhas93/DeepLabv3FineTuning 

### Executing program
#### MacOS instructions:

* First make sure that a virtual environment is setup and contains all of the libraries
1. First, put all of the microscopy images into a folder and change the directory path in the terminal to the path where the images are
2. Put the trained weights file into the same folder as this repository. To get a sample trained weights file, contact the authors. For training your own weights file from your own segmented images: [Training code](https://github.com/msminhas93/DeepLabv3FineTuning)
3. Run the below command:
```
python process_images.py *.tif --write_nn_mask --write_threshold_mask --write_filled_cells
```
* If don't want to create all of the intermediate files such as the mask or filled_cells images, then one can remove those parameters:
```
python process_images.py *.tif 
```
* If you have a weights file that you want to use then you can add an optional argument to specify which you want to use:
```
python process_images.py *.tif --weights_file <name of file>
```

#### WindowsOS instructions:

* Same starting process as MacOS instructions except use this command:
```
for %i in (*.tif) do python3 process_images.py %i [--write_nn_mask] [--write_threshold_mask] [--write_filled_cells] [--weights_file <name of file>]
```
## Help

Running the program without any arguments like so:
```
python process_images.py *.tif
```
will bring the help menu up for more information on what arguments can be passed through
