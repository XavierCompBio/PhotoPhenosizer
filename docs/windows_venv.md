## Installation Guide
1. Make sure that python is downloaded from: https://www.python.org

```
cd "[path of directory here]"
```
4. Enter the following commands:
```
py -m venv [name of environment]
```
5. This should create a folder of the name of the environment in the directory that you specified in step 2
