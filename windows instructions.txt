# Method 1: Getting a zsh shell on windows to allow for same terminal interactions

*install terminal from microsoft store

https://dev.to/vsalbuq/how-to-install-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10-home-edition-49g2

*enable linux subsystem on windows machine
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
*install ubuntu through windows store
*open up ubuntu in the windows start menu
*commands to input: 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install zsh
zsh
*select 2 as the set up option for the zsh shell
sudo apt-get install curl
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

*close out of all the terminal windows and open up the windows terminal from the microsoft store from step 1
*adjust the settings so that the linux terminal is the default and the startingDirectory is set to wherever
you want

*close and re open the terminal and use the "cd" command to set the directory to where the virtual environment
will be. (might have to look up how to use the "cd" command in linux to navigate around the directories)

Follow the rest of the steps in the README.md

# Method 2: Using a different command for to get the same results but wont have the zsh shell (works the fastest)

* follow the same instructions as README.md to create a virtual environment
Use this command to run the program instead of the MacOS command: for %i in (*.tif) do python process_images.py %i
